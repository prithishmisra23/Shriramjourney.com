## Why Dual Licensing?

This dual licensing approach serves our mission:

- **MIT for code**: Encourages developers worldwide to improve and extend our platform without restrictions
- **CC-BY-SA for content**: Protects spiritual and cultural content while allowing global sharing and 
  localization with attribution. Ensures Dharma knowledge remains in the community.

This balances innovation (code freedom) with preservation (content integrity).
