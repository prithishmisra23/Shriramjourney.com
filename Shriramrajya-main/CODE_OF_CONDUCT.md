## Dharma Inspiration

Our Code of Conduct is grounded in timeless Dharma values:

**From the Ramayana:**
- **Ahimsa (Non-violence)**: "Do not harm others in body, mind, or speech"
- **Satya (Truthfulness)**: "Speak truth with kindness"
- **Asteya (Non-stealing)**: "Respect others' time, ideas, and contributions"
- **Brahmacharya (Right conduct)**: "Maintain moral and ethical standards"
- **Aparigraha (Non-attachment)**: "Let go of ego; work for community benefit"

**Seva Principle:** We serve each other selflessly, building community without expectation of return.

> "The code of conduct is not punishment—it's a commitment to create a space where all feel safe, respected, and able to contribute their gifts to our shared Dharma mission." 🙏
